![Data Analytics](https://bairesdev.mo.cloudinary.net/blog/2023/06/Is-Python-good-for-software-development.jpg?tx=w_1024,q_auto)

## Course Introduction & Purpose
This module provided foundational knowledge and practical skills in programming and data analytics. By the end of the course, learners were able to:

- Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
- Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
- Develop software that incorporated and utilized standard numerical libraries.
- Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

## Weekly Content and Tasks
### Week 1: Representing Data
We explored how data can be represented in different formats, focusing on CSV and JSON. Specifically, we discussed:

The structure and characteristics of CSV files, including delimiters, quotes, and how to read them as lists, dictionaries, and Pandas DataFrames.
JSON files, their structure, and methods to read data from local files and web sources.

#### Task 1: Create a GitHub repository for this module.

### Week 2: Plotting and Visualising Data
During the second week, we focused on visualising data and creating clear, effective plots using Python. We covered:

- An introduction to data visualisation, explaining its importance and applications.
- A review of Matplotlib, exploring the fundamentals of creating plots and customizing visual elements.
- Techniques for creating multiple axes on a single figure, demonstrating how to display different datasets side by side or stacked for better comparison.

#### Task 2: create a Jupyter Notebook to plot the dry bulb temperature over time.

### Week 3: Revising Pandas
In the third week, we revisited Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The lectures focused on:

- An overview of Pandas, including its purpose and capabilities for reading and writing data to/from various formats.
- Techniques for manipulating data, such as:
  - Selecting specific columns and rows using .loc and .iloc.
  - Creating and deleting columns and rows dynamically.
  - Guidance on where to find additional resources to deepen our knowledge of Pandas.

#### Task 3: create a Jupiter Notebook that featured a pie chart illustrating the distribution of email domains in the CSV file

### Week 4: Regular Expressions
In the fourth week, we explored Regular Expressions (RegEx), a powerful tool for searching, matching, and manipulating strings. The lectures focused on:

- An introduction to Regular Expressions, explaining their syntax and common use cases.
- Using the re module in Python to implement RegEx for string manipulation tasks.
- Applying RegEx within Pandas, showcasing how it can enhance data preprocessing and cleaning.

#### Task 4: there were no specific tasks assigned this week. Instead, a lab session was used to practice the concepts introduced in the lectures.


### Week 5: NumPy and Random number generation
During the fifth week, we focused on NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computations, and techniques for generating random numbers. The topics covered included:

- Introduction to NumPy:
  - What NumPy is and how it leverages compiled code for performance.
  - Fundamental operations with matrices and arrays.
  - A guide to exploring the NumPy documentation for further learning.
- Random Number Generation:
  - Understanding pseudo-random number generators.
  - Setting random seeds for reproducibility.
  - Exploring different ranges and distributions for random numbers.

#### Task 5: create a notebook that simulates 1,000 battle rounds in Risk (3 attackers vs 2 defenders).

### Week 6: More on PANDAS
In Week 6, we expanded our knowledge of Pandas by focusing on working with dates and times, analyzing time series data, and exploring data sources in the cloud. Key topics included:

- Python datetime module:
  - Manipulating dates and times programmatically.
  - Converting strings to datetime objects.
- Time Series Analysis in Pandas:
  - Cleaning and parsing real-world time series data.
  - Setting the DataFrame index to a datetime column.
  - Resampling and aggregating data based on time intervals.
- Synthetic Data Generation:
  - Creating time series data using date_range().
  - Generating random numbers with Poisson distributions.
  - Simulating data with specific characteristics.

#### Task 6: create a notebook that analyzes the Knock Airport weather data which included temperature analysis and wind speed analysis.
