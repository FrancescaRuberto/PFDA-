## Course Introduction & Purpose
This module provided foundational knowledge and practical skills in programming and data analytics. By the end of the course, learners were able to:

- Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
- Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
- Develop software that incorporated and utilized standard numerical libraries.
- Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

### Weekly Content and Tasks
#### Week 1: Representing Data
We explored how data can be represented in different formats, focusing on CSV and JSON. Specifically, we discussed:

The structure and characteristics of CSV files, including delimiters, quotes, and how to read them as lists, dictionaries, and Pandas DataFrames.
JSON files, their structure, and methods to read data from local files and web sources.

#### Task 1: Create a GitHub repository for this module.

#### Week 2: Plotting and Visualising Data
During the second week, we focused on visualising data and creating clear, effective plots using Python. We covered:

- An introduction to data visualisation, explaining its importance and applications.
- A review of Matplotlib, exploring the fundamentals of creating plots and customizing visual elements.
- Techniques for creating multiple axes on a single figure, demonstrating how to display different datasets side by side or stacked for better comparison.

#### Task 2: create a Jupyter Notebook to plot the dry bulb temperature over time.

#### Week 3: Revising Pandas
In the third week, we revisited Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The lectures focused on:

- An overview of Pandas, including its purpose and capabilities for reading and writing data to/from various formats.
- Techniques for manipulating data, such as:
  - Selecting specific columns and rows using .loc and .iloc.
  - Creating and deleting columns and rows dynamically.
  - Guidance on where to find additional resources to deepen our knowledge of Pandas.

#### Tasks 3: create a Jupiter Notebook that featured a pie chart illustrating the distribution of email domains in the CSV file
