## Course Introduction & Purpose
This module provided foundational knowledge and practical skills in programming and data analytics. By the end of the course, learners were able to:

- Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
- Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
- Develop software that incorporated and utilized standard numerical libraries.
- Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

### Weekly Content and Tasks
#### Week 1: Representing Data
We explored how data can be represented in different formats, focusing on CSV and JSON. specifically, we discussed:

The structure and characteristics of CSV files, including delimiters, quotes, and how to read them as lists, dictionaries, and Pandas DataFrames.
JSON files, their structure, and methods to read data from local files and web sources.

#### Task 1: Create a GitHub repository for this module.
